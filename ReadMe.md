#Final Math Mark Prediction and Graphs

##main:
    main contains all algorithmns used to create the graphs used in the analysis

##main2:
    main2 contains the model creation. Note that halve of the columns were removed as
    they had minimal effects on the model and the numerical values had the greatest 
    effects

##main3:
    main3 contains the some testing data for the model created in main2 
    many of the results are within one mark of the correct value.
